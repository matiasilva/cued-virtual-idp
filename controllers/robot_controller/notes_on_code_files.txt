All .cpp and .h files that need to be included must be added to the Makefile

Everything is declared in header.h, except stuff within classes

Basic maths functions are defined in other.cpp

For classes, declare everything in their header. Define small things in their header and large things in their .cpp

Known potential issues with code:
	database.h, line 99
	navigation.h, line 22

Always put a '\n' at the end of any string passed to 'printf()', as it seems that these strings are only written to the webots console every time a '\n' is printed.
		(calling just 'printf("foo")' will appear to do nothing;
		 calling 'printf("foo")' then later calling 'printf("bar\n")' will print "foobar\n" to the
		 console AT THE TIME YOU CALL 'printf("bar\n")')

Don't use 'assert' for test code, 'assert(false)' just crashes the controller without any explanation in the Webots console. Instead just use 'printf' or something similar.

On windows, disable the visualiser by making changes in the following places:
	Makefile lines 44, 54, 57
	header.h line 19
	database.h lines 13, 156
	database.cpp lines 25, 35, 372
	navigation.h line 58
