All .cpp and .h files that need to be included must be added to the Makefile

Everything is declared in header.h, except stuff within classes

Basic maths functions are defined in other.cpp

For classes, declare everything in their header. Define small things in their header and large things in their .cpp

Known potential issues with code:
	database.h, line 99
	navigation.h, line 22
